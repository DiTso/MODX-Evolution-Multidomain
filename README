MODX Evolution Multidomain plugin
---------------------------------

The Multidomain plugin for MODX Evolution enables to manage multiple domains with one MODX installation.


Install instructions
--------------------

1. Copy the assets folder into your MODX Evolution installation folder

   If you want to rename of "domains.xml" or move the file into a different folder, you will need to change the value of the "$xml_file" variable in the file "assets/lib/multidomain/DocumentParser_Extended.php".

2. Edit the file "assets/files/domains.xml" (self explaining) to setup your domain settings

3. Create a new plugin for automatic change and updating index.php files

    Name: multidomainUpdate

    Code:
        include MODX_BASE_PATH."assets/lib/multidomain/check_index.php";

    Events:
        OnManagerLogin

!!! NOTE: The root folder and the /manager folder must be writeable by MODX !!!


4. Edit .htaccess file

    a. to hide "domain.xml" from the webbrowser
    b. to set the prefix "www" for the domain

    # a. hide "domain.xml" from the webbrowser
    <files 'domains.xml'>
        order allow,deny
        deny from all
    </files>


    # b. before the section "For Friendly Urls"
    
    # http://domain1.com > http://www.domain1.com
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} .
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^domain1\.com [NC]
    RewriteRule (.*) http://www.%{HTTP_HOST}/$1 [R=301,L]
    
    # http://domain2.com > http://www.domain2.com
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} .
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^domain2\.com [NC]
    RewriteRule (.*) http://www.%{HTTP_HOST}/$1 [R=301,L]

    !!! NOTE: Subdomains like sub1.domain1.com or sub2.domain1.com don't need no redirection. !!!
    
    
    Optional: General redirection from http://mydomain.tld to http://www.mydomain.tld
    !!! NOTE: Do this only if you don't have any subdomains. !!!
    
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} .
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^www\. [NC]
    RewriteRule (.*) http://www.%{HTTP_HOST}/$1 [R=301,L]

5. Confirming changes in index.php files

    After logging out from manager's backend and logging in again, a message on the dashoard appears which tells you that the index.php files have been modified. Then you will have to refresh the checksums.


TROUBLESHOOTING:

If you update from a previous version and have troubles:
  * log out from the manager's backend
  * push the index.php and manager/index.php files from the original MODX installation package to your server (and overwrite the existing ones)
  * log in to the manager's backend
  * then the plugin will make the needed changes to the index.php files automatically

KNOWN BUGS:
  * Alias names need to differ from Domain names. See https://github.com/Sammyboy/MODX-Evolution-Multidomain/issues/2
